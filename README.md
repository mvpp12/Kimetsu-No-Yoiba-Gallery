# Demons Slayer — Gallery

Simple static gallery showcasing ten characters from Demon Slayer with CSS animations and a modal viewer.

How to use
- Open `Demon Slayer_Gallery/index.html` in your browser.
- The page expects character images in the sibling `pictures` folder and the background in the sibling `backgrounds` folder.

Image expectations (relative to this folder):
- `../pictures/tanjiro.jpg`
- `../pictures/nezuko.jpg`
- `../pictures/zenitsu.jpg`
- `../pictures/Inosuke.jpg`
- `../pictures/kanao.jpg` (please add if missing)
- `../pictures/Giyu.jpg`
- `../pictures/shinobu.jpg`
- `../pictures/Rengoku.jpg`
- `../pictures/tengen.jpg`
- `../pictures/muzan.jpeg`

Background image (recommended):
- `../backgrounds/Infinity-Castle-main.webp` (falls back to an included `.avif` if missing)

Notes
- If files are missing, place the correct image files into the `pictures` and `backgrounds` sibling directories.
- Open the `index.html` file directly in the browser (double-click or `file:///` path).
